What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new space for you to start saving commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging area allows you to seperate things out before commiting while the repository is the log of commits and the working directory is just all the files. Allows you to get organized as you start a new repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I can do this by adding things to the stagging area as I go along, and only commiting when I think a logical change has been made. It cna also help me go back to make commits when I may have forgotten to before (up until a certain point at least).

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches are good for really any experimental change you want to make as it kind of creates its own, attached project without effect the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
